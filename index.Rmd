## Hey curios fellow,

design can be hard, especially for non-designers. I saw many scientists struggle, we all struggle.

This page is my personal collection of basic design tips, tricks, links, tools and more I compiled to make my life a little bit easier. Get inspired and maybe improve the design of your projects, scientific figures, presentations, posters, or whatever you are doing.



**Disclaimer**

This is by far no guidline or tutorial. I am no designer or design student and just want to help everyone kickstarted with tips and tricks.
