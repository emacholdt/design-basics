  <h1>Hey curios fellow,</h1>
  <p>Design can be hard, especially for non-designers. I saw many scientists struggle, inlcuding myself. <b> We all struggle</b>.</p>
  <p>This page is my personal collection of basic design tips, tricks, links, tools, and more that I compiled to make my life a little bit easier. Get inspired and maybe improve the design of your scientific projects, figures, presentations, posters, or whatever you are doing. </p>

**Disclaimer**

This page is not complete yet and is by far no guidline or tutorial. I am not a designer nor design student, but I want to help everyone get kickstarted with some very basic tips and tricks.
